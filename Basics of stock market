Basics of stock market
 • LTCG: long term capital gain
if a person holds shares for more than 1 year and earns profit then that profit is known as long term capital gain
long term means more than 1 year
and that capital gain is tax free upto 2.5 L and whatever will be above 2.5 L, tax will be applied @ 10% irrespective of our income amount

 • divjdend is return on investment in shares
we get dividend from shares (like we get interest from fds)
dividend is also taxfree but upto 10 L
its company's decision whether to declare dividend or not and whatever will be above 10 L, tax will be applied @10% irrespective of our income amount

 • promoters are the people who starts the company

 • face value: cost of one share decided by the promoters of the company (when they start the company)
if I invest 1 lakh rs in the starting of the company and we decided to keep the face value = 2 rs then I will be holding 50000 shares of that company
and the proof that I own those shares is written in my Demat account.

 • demat account contains the details of the shares you hold

 • if a company has few shareholders/investers/promoters then that company is pvt ltd
but if that company wants to bring more funds in the company then they declare the initial price of the shares and after that anyone can invest in their company and therefore company becomes public limited
that initial price is called initial public offering (IPO)
if face price of the share is ₹2 (which is generally less) as that value is the value when company has started
but IPO is quite high as at that time company is established
and whoever is thinks that company has more potential, buys the shares of that company


 • turnover (top line growth) = expenses + profit
bottom line growth = profit after tax


 • stock split = if a company share price becomes higher and company thinks that now more people will not be able to buy our stocks then they decrease their face value
for eg. if company had their face value = 2 rs and if they decreased it to 1 rs then all the existing shareholder's shares will be doubled as face value is half
(if I am the promoter and 1 invested 1 lakhs and we decided face value to be 2 rs then I had shares = 50000 but now we are doing half of the face value so my shares will double)
bcz of decrease in face value, share price will also decrease (half here) (but it will be neutral for me as I now have double of the previous number of shares) so now more people will be able to buy my company's shares.

people with less knowledge will just see the stats that ohh share price decreased so that mnz that company is not doing good and therefore will not invest in that company but intelligent person will invest as he will find out the reason behind the decrease in share price, which is stock split (here) and will think that now share price is less so I can get more shares of the company.

so stock split is the split in face value of the share.


 • cum dividend (cumulative dividend): before dividend

 • ex dividend (excluding dividend): after dividend


 • primary market (or new issue market): when some company gets listed on stock exchange or a company comes with an IPO through primary market. It is a direct transaction between issuer and the invester.
When company gives shares after receiving the price of those shares, everything gets listed on secondary market (NSE and BSC). Now when we want to sell our shares then we can't sell them back to company, we will be selling it to another invester.
Therefore in secondary market, there is transaction between one invester and another.


 • secondary market is also known as stock exchange. Two famous stock exchanges are BSE and NSE.

 • maximum number of shareholders in a pvt LTD company = 200
if we want more funds then we will require more shareholders and to increase number of shareholders, we will have to first make our company public limited. Then anyone can invest in my company by buying my company's shares.
There is no restriction on maximum number of shares in a public lmt company.


 • concept of BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) and NSE (National Stock Exchange): both are located in Mumbai


 • Trading account: An account through which you trade (buy or sell shares) and those shares are kept in your DeMat account. Trading accound is share's rasta and DeMat account is share's manzil.


 • one can have 2 or more DeMat account.
DeMat account is the account which is used to store shares.


 • contract note: it is like a receipt issued by broker to invester which gives various details.
It is mandatory for the broker to send a contract note within 24 hours of buying a share. So invester need to register their mobile number or email id with broker and stock exchange.
Broker has to mandatory send the details of the price of your stocks everyday


 • t+2 settlement: it is system where the transaction is settled after 2 working days in other words if you trade today then that trade will be settled after 2 working days.


 • bid quantity: the number of buy orders of a company (if I want 20 shares of a company then that is 1 buy order)


 • offer quantity: number of sell orders of a company


 • volume: number of shares traded during a day


 • today's low/high: today's lowest price of that company's shares and today's highest price of that company's shares.

 • moneycontrol.com for checking the stocks of a company

 • LTP (Last Traded Price) : the price at which the stock was traded last
BSE and NSE are two different markets and price of a stock could be different on both markets.


 • pre opening market session: 9:00 am to 9:15 am
it is kept to decrease the fluctuations in the initial state of market

 • AMO (After Market Order) : orders which are placed between 4:00 pm to 9:00 am
we can place AMOs but they will get executed after 9:15 am

 • closing share price of the previous day will be 99.99% different from today's opening price of that share bcz of AMOs.
here too demand and supply concept works, if demand of a share is alot and there are very few who are selling their share then price goes high so that seeing the higher price shareholders sell their shares and not everyone demand for that share seeing the higher price, this balances the situation.


 • Gap Up Opening: by how much the price got higher as compared to the yesterday's closing price of its share. It is displayed in brackets.
similarly there is Gap Down Opening.
and also there is a shortform written (UNCH) indicating that there is no change in the today's price of the stock as compared to yesterday's price which is very rare.


 • Bonus shares: this works little bit same as stocks split. company declares the bonus share in the ratio.
for eg. if company said that they will give bonus share in ratio 1:2 then that mnz if I have 2 share of that company then I will get 1 more share of that company. Now does that mnz I gained profit? No, bcz market price of that share goes 1/3 to keep the value intact. (here face value will remail unchanged) But you indirectly gets benefit bcz when market price drops, more and more people will buy that share and therefore market price will increase, as now you have double shares, you gain from that increase in market price.
for definition: these are free shares issued by the company to the investers.


 • How do we check whether a company has given bonus or not?
go to the money control website, search for the company, go to bottom left menu, goto corporate actions, again a submenu will emerge, goto bonus


 • company announces that company will gonna declare bonus soon much prior than it actually gives bonus. So people can buy the company's shares after announcement too. Implementation date is known as release date.


 • ex-bonus date is the date till when people can buy that company's shares to get bonus and that ex-bonus date = release date - 2 working days.
We should buy that company's shares one day prior to ex-bonus date to get bonus.
therefore it is the date on which shares gets traded @ revised (low here) price.


 • release date is the date on which you must have shares on your demat account to gain bonus.


 • Types of Investers:
RII(Retail Individual Investor): small investers category, person investing <= 2 lakhs rupees in any company's shares comes under this category.

HNI(High Networth Individual): invester investing more than 2 lakh rupees in any company's shares.

DII(Domestic Institutional Investor): Banks, LIC, Insurance Policies, Mutual Funds etc comes under this category.


FPI(Foreign Portfolio Investor)/FII(Foreign Institutional Investor):


 • NSDL(National Securities Depository Ltd) and CDSL(Central Depository Service Ltd) are two depository of india who converts physical share certificates to DeMat format.


 • (DP)Depository Participant: broker is DP who is directly in touch with depositories.


 • we can buy upto 5% shares of a company without any disclosure
after that we have to tell our intentions.


 • face value has to be in multiples of 1


 • Types of orders:
Limit Order: invester bargains and doesn't gets ready to buy or sell at current market price.
Market Price Order: it is an order where buyer/seller is ready to buy/sell at current market price. (without bargaining)
Stop Loss Order: order in which we can tell upto how much loss I can afford. if share's price drops below a particular rate then your shares will be sold if any buyer is there.
it is an order placed by a buyer at a price lower than the buying price.


 • IOC (Immediate or Cancel): it is an order where a trader wants to immediately execute his/her buyer or sell order if not possible then cancel.


 • brokers maintain 2 books, order and trade, if someone orders shares then it will be displayed in order book
when that order will get completed then it will also strts getting visible in trade book.


 • GTD(Good Till Day): if I have kept an order at some price lesser than last traded price then if share's price reaches of that amount or someone gets ready to buy that share on that particular day when order is placed then order will get exercuted or it will get cancelled after 3:30 pm


 • GTC(Good Till Cancel): in this order will still remain in order book until trader cancels that order.


 • Short sale order: In this order, we first sell shares and then buy those shares. We generally do this when we know that price of a company's shares will be going down (when traders are bearish about the market).
So, we sell shares of a company at 200 (let) and then when price reaches less than 200 and according to how much profit we want to gain then we buy those shares and by that we square off our position.
Yes, this is possible. But we have to square off our position before that day market ends.

We can also place a short sell order when we already have the shares. Basically we can square off our position by selling our shares of that company from our DeMat account.

If in any case we couldn't buy that shares till 3:30 then broker's role comes in
from 3:30 to 4 there is broker's market in which there is share auction. Then in that broker do all the clearing of their clients.
If our broker too couldn't buy the shares then we get panalty from SEBI which is at most 20% of the shares price which we sold.
Even if broker was able to buy shares at lesser price than what you sold, you wont get any profit bcz sebi takes that profit bcz of IEPF.
but atleast you won't get any panalty.
Because of all this, this is clear that short sell is very dangerous (high chance of facing loss). but you can perform if you already have those shares in your demat (but that might be of any profit, bcz you could have normally sold those shares bcz price is already going down)


 • Intra Day: A day in which we did buy shares and sells all those shares.


 • Stop Loss Market order: order where we set a trigger price but we are ok if shares gets sold after few seconds/mili seconds and there selling price is not equal to our set triggered price bcz that day market is volatile and prices may change in few mili seconds or seconds.
But in 90% of the cases shares will not be this volatile.



 • Slipage: difference between triggered price and actual selling price.



 • Stop Loss limit order: In this we keep our stop less price lesser than Triggered price.
Our stop loss gets activated after hiting triggered price, but it only gets squared off when share price hits stop loss price, if market it very volatile and if it couldn't get squared off at stop loss then even if price goes further down, it won't sell.
It will only be squared off at stop loss limit.
It's very risky.



 • Stop Loss (loss of profit):
Market: this is applied when we don't want loose profit.
For eg. if we buy shares at 90 and we are bullish about the market, but we don't know whether it will go down after going up then we can put a stop loss at a particular price to determine that if share price gets triggered to that high then we are happy with that profit and we want to sell. If market is volatile then after hitting the triggered price, our shares will be sold whenever possible.

 • Market is corrected by: mnz market has gone down by.



 • To stop the big loss of the investers, bse and nse apply circuit filters to the previous day's last traded price of that share.
most popular circuit filters can be 5%, 10%, 20% of the previous day's LTP
If the share price gained 20% of previous day's LTP then it is said to hit upper circuit.
Similarly in opposite case, lower circuit.
to define circuit filters we can say, it is a price level beyond which/below which a stock price cannot rise/fall on a single day.

That circuit %age will be shown to us as LC (Lower Circuit) or LB (lower band) or LF (lower filter).

If there is a bad news in the company then BSE NSE shrinks down the circuit filters to reduce the loss of the investers.

If the company's stocks are listed in F&O (Future & Options) segment then in that company's stocks, circuit filters are not listed.



 • If stock price is 100 and its low compared to previous trend then more people try to buy those stocks then price go higher to 150 (let), then some people who buyed at 100 gets satisfied at that higher price, so starts selling their stocks so price goes low to 130 (let) then people who couldn't buy at 100 thinks of buying at 130 so share price again goes higher to 200, then more people at 100 or 130 sells their stocks, so price goes low to 180. Now not more people buys that stock as researchers know that stock price is at higher position from its average position. But very few people will still gonna buy seeing the drop in the price, then stock price again goes higher but this time to 192 as very few people bought. Now many people saw this, that stock price didn't go higher from its previous high then stock price may follow downward trend. So more people start selling their shares. So price again goes down till 145. Like this downward trend starts following.
So researcher need to see that has share goes higher from its previous high, if yes then probability of more increase are high and if not then maybe there will be downward trend.



 • Higher Top Higher Bottom defines the upward trend.
Similarly series of Lower Top Lower bottom depicts lower trend.
If none of the above is there then it is a sideways trend.


 • if line chart shows big trend mnz big low or big high then after that chart will go sideways.


 • if you can't judge a daily chart then go for weekly chart, if you can't judge weekly then go for monthly chart.
Monthly chart is like big wave which takes over the daily and weekly chart.



 • learn support and resistance in trend analysis.



 • Upper Circuit: The top most price beyond which the share cannot move up on a single day. It is typically characterised by all buyers and no/very few sellers.
Exactly opposite for Lower Circuit.
If it is the first day of listing on secondary markets then circuit filters will not be applied.



 • Market Capitalisation: Number of shares * market price per share



 • If face value of a share is ₹2 and market value of a share is ₹1000 then it is said that share is trading at a premium of ₹998.


 • Companies with high market capitalisation are known as blue chip companies.


 • Block deal: trading of large amount of shares at once.


 • Ring trading: This type of trade happens in small stocks. What happens is there are few friends say 6, one buys 1 lakhs shares of a company at ₹10 per share and sells all those shares on AON order at ₹11 per share. His friend has put up an AON buy order at ₹11 per share so that he gets his friend's shares and this cycle continues within them.
At time of the 6th friend, market price of those shares must have raised. So people starts considering those shares bcz they thinks that there is some news about that company bcz of which price of its shares are increasing. So market value grows even higher bcz demands increases. So that 6th friend sells the shares even at higher price and all of them(friends) enjoys the profit.
Other people who thought of investing in those shares becomes fool. After this bubble gets burst, that company shares fell even below ₹10 per share and all of the other people face loss.
This ring trading is illegal, SEBI and stock exchanges checks these types of activities.



 • AON(All Or None) Order: All the types of orders mentioned above are on the basis of the price, but this order is on the basis of quantity.
In this order buyer or seller sets the quantity that he/she wants to buy/sell n number of shares at once, if possible then place order or don't place order.



 • Minimum Fill Order: Order in which I want a big quantity of stocks (like 1 lakhs) and I have kept a quantity like 20,000 which I want at once. If one is selling 10,000 shares then I don't want from him/her.



 • Bid Ask Spread: If someone is ready to buy a stock at ₹102 per share but the seller wants to sell his/her stocks at ₹104 per stock then the difference between their price is known as bid ask spread. Here it's ₹2. If bid ask spread remains then trade will not occur.


 • LTP(Last Traded Price): It is the price at which last trade of that share happened.



 • Disclosed Quantity Order: when the seller has huge quantity of shares to sell then he/she can apply DQ in which he can show his shares parts by parts. Bcz if seller discloses whole quantity at once then buyer will understand that seller desperately wants to sell his shares as he has big quantity of shares. So buyer will not increase his buying price. So, DQ helps seller in this case. Buyer can also apply DQ in his order.



 • Market Index: It is an index which tells a overall situation of market. Basically it is a representative figure.



 • Nifty: It is a market index of NSE comprising top 50 stocks.
NIFTY = Nse fIFTY



 • Sensex: It is a market index of BSE comprising top 30 stocks.
SENSEX = SENSitivity indEX



 • here top mnz highest free float market capitalisation.



 • Sensex is gone up by 2% then I'm telling 2% by comparing it with previous day price.


 • Free float market capitalisation: It is calculated as number of shares freely floating x current market price of that company's share

Freely floating shares are the shares which are with investers (not with promoters) and are not available for general trading purpose.



 • According to SEBI, a company's promoters can only keep maximum 75% of the company's shares with them.


 • Promoters pledging shares: In this promoters take loan against part of shares held by them. It can be checked on moneycontrol.in.
Promoters takes loan to use(ideally) that money in their own company.



 • Nifty and Sensex value is very different from each other because both of them have different base year and therefore different base value.



 • Market Indices (Sensex and Nifty) update their top companies twice every year. Its not like they will update every day.



 • NASDAQ is the stock index of USA



 • lot size: it is a number, multiple of which we can buy shares of a product or company.
lot size of a share is 1 in cash segment that is why we can buy a company's 1,2,3,... shares but we can't buy 2.3 shares of a company bcz 2.3 is not a multiple of 1.
Similarly, Nifty's lot size is 75. So one can buy 75,150,225,.... Nifty.



 • margin money is token to a layman. As Nifty's price will be very high for just 1 nifty bcz amount = 75 x 15000 (current value of nifty)
So anyone can keep a token(lesser amount) with the broker and can buy nifty.



 • For primary market (IPO), lot size differs company to company.



IPO
 • fresh shares are issued out of unissued capital.



OFS (Offer For Sale)
 • shares are issued out of promoters holdings.



 • FPO (Further Public Offering): When a listed company comes up with a fresh funding offer then it is known as FPO.



 • Book value: net worth of 1 share, can be calculated as (assets - external liabilities)/number of shares



 • merchant banker: helps company in entire IPO process.



 • Book building issue: price band given to the investers to apply for shares.



 • Prospectus: It is an offer document where in all major details of the company will be given.



 • over subscription: if a company gets over subscribed  then lottery system comes into play in which anyone applied can get complete(applied) shares.



 • underwriter: an institution which subscribes for number of shares = difference between minimum subscription and actual subscription.
Why would that institution take that risk?
bcz it gets underwriting commission from company.
If company could not sell minimum number of shares then it doesn't gets listed.



 • price band: it is a range of price offered to the investers for biding for the IPO. In that case IPO is known as Book Built Issue IPO.



 • small invester should invest at the highest price of the issue range bcz if company decides the issue price lesser than the highest price of the range then the difference is refunded to the invester and if the invester has bid for the lesser price then issue price then his bid gets cancelled according to law.



 • price determination for IPO: important factor is minimum subscription of 90%




 • before biding for a company's IPO, one should see where it will gonna be listed. If it will gonna be listed on BSE, NSE then its ok but if its gonna be listed on some other then liquidity issue can arrive mnz if you wanna sell then there might be the higher chance that there are no buyer to buy shares.




 • RTA(Registrar & Transfer Agent): they are responsible for transferring Demat shares to investers account.




 • Banker to the issue is the one who manages the escrow account.




 • escrow account: it is a account with a defined purpose bcz company raising funds needs to tell why that company wants funds, where it will gonna use those funds. Therefore, investers put their money in this account.




 • ASBA(Application Supported by Blocked Amounts): it is a facility through which, amount doesn't gets debited but just gets frozen from the savings account itself.




 • Chittorgarh.com is the website which gives better information regarding IPOs.
Before investing one should check the top line and bottom line of the company, Object of Issue, EBIT(Earning Before Interest & Taxes)/Operating Profit, Listing At.



 • Bonds: it is the money which we directly gives to the company as a loan. Expecting a rate of interest (called coupon rate).
